# Potluck Party!

## Motivation

I like making food for people. Feeding people makes me happy. Guess what? We are
in quarantine right now.

So what does that mean?

No food for random folks.

So yeah. Currently dreaming of doing that again.

## Tech Stack

* React (latest version)
* Node (latest version)
* Redux and TypeScript (maybe?) - depends on how complex this simple app gets
    and how much I want to flex some of those muscles again.

## Eventually...

* You can create a Potluck.
* You can invite people to your Potluck.
* Your friends can say what they're bringing (a Dish).
* Everyone can see what everyone else is bringing on a cute little interface.
* This is meant to be fun. And get people motivated to be together again.
* ...but maybe it will just make people depressed. I hope not.
